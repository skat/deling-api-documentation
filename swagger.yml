    # Introduction
    This is the API for receiving filings concerning citizens taxable transactions, from sharing economy platforms, for project DEL (Dele√∏konomi).
    This REST API is built, in order for platforms to send in relevant income data to Skatteforvaltningen on their users and their rentals.

    The API is organized around [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer), using JSON as the payload format. Our API has resource-oriented URLs and uses HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors.

    The API allows manipulation of three types of resources:
      - vehicle filings
      - boat filings
      - accommodation filings
      
    A filing resource is uniquely identified by a platformId and a filingReference. In case multiple versions of the resource have been created these can be distinguished by a sequence number which is part of the payload. The sequence number starts at zero and increments by one for every new version of the filing.

    # URL
    The path structure for creating a filing resource has the following structure:

    ```POST <host>/platforms/<platformId>/<assetType>-filings/<filingReference>```
    
    The three placeholders have the following semantics:
    - platformId - the ID assigned to the platform during the onboarding-process.
    - assetType - the asset type being filed for. Currently vehicle, boat or accommodation.
    - filingReference - the platform's internal reference for the filing. 

    Here is an example for the initial filing for a car:   

    ```POST <host>/platforms/85232389-c876-40a4-9b67-f95eec44825d/vehicle-filings/1234567```

    To get the filing resource use the following url:

    ```GET <host>/platforms/85232389-c876-40a4-9b67-f95eec44825d/vehicle-filings/1234567```

    # PersonIdToken
    The tax payers are linked to your platform through a unique ID-token where one of the fields in the post payload contains this information.
    This token will be generated the first time they allow your platform to report on their behalf, but until we are in production however,
    you can use any of the ones below for testing purposes.

    | Tokens    |
    |-----------|
    | 123456789 |

    # Requests
    Every request to the api must have the following two headers:
    - X-Transaktions-ID
    - X-Request-ID

    Each must be a unique UUIDv4 for every request. 

    # Corrections
    There are two types of filings:
    - Regular filings. These filing contain actual business data about revenue inside a filingData-element in the JSON payload.
    - Invalidations - these void whatever was filed previously for the given filing resource. The invalidation has no filingData-element.
    Whenever a new version of a resource is created, the old one is disregarded. 

    The following example flow illustrates how a resource is created, corrected and invalidated.

    | sequenceNumber | has filingData-element | Http status | current sequenceNumber    | Description                                                 |
    |----------------|------------------------|-------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
    | 0              | yes                    | 201         | 0                         | Filing is filed                                             |
    | 1              | yes                    | 400         | no current sequenceNumber | The sequence number has to be 0 in the initial filing       | 
    | 1              | no                     | 201         | 1                         | This is an invalidation, old resource is disregarded        | 
    | 2              | no                     | 201         | 2                         | An invalidation, old resource is disregarded                | 
    | 3              | yes                    | 400         | 1                         | Wrong sequence number, expected 2                           | 
    | 3              | yes                    | 201         | 3                         | New version of filing is filed, old resource is disregarded | 
    | 4              | yes                    | 201         | 4                         | New version of filing is filed, old resource is disregarded |
