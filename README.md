# deling-api-documentation
This site is used for hosting documentation concerning the filing-api for project dele√∏konomi. 

We are using OpenAPI which are then rendered using [ReDoc](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc).

All logic takes place in the swagger.yml file. 

Currently, the json schemas and responses which the swagger.yml file then points to are situated in the documents folder. 

However, in the future
these schemas should be hosted at some site, where they can be updated everytime changes affect our code.
